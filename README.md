Welcome to my first experiments around my Google Pixel Watch!

TODO:
- Add more sensor data and display it on the screen
- Keep reading data in the background (so even if the screen turns off)
- Experiment with the vibration functionality to create a calm vibration pattern for sleep
- Research ways to predict health difficulties, like an allergic reaction or an incoming bad night of sleep
